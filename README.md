### ⚡️ What is this
- These are HTML/CSS/JS landing pages, the idea is to give one to one coding classes, so here is the value proposal
- I took the initial file from a template I bought in envato market [here](https://themeforest.net/item/geco-esports-gaming-html5-template/26217041), I am over writting the code to adapt It to my idea
- The templates use bootstrap, jquery and other JS dependencies
- Fully responsive design
- The way I am planning to deploy this is: Open a hosting, install wordpress, install a clean templeate like underscore and upload each page one by one, and link correctly the dependencias and anchor links
- The reason to choose wordpress is because I want to manage newsletters with mailchimp, connect contact form and add easily whatsapp chat using plugins + Connect calendly to schedule the classes


### ⚙️ How to install
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/RolandoDrRobot/Dev-Monster.git`

### ⚙️ How to use
